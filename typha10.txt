Here's the R code to perform statistical tests and generate the required graphical representations for the cattail_data.csv dataset. This includes:

Testing if weeks_submerged affects survival.
Testing if height, flowers, or shoots affect survival.
Generating graphical representations for these tests.

Explanation:
Chi-Squared Test: Used to determine if there's a significant association between weeks_submerged and survival. This is suitable for categorical data.
Logistic Regression: Used to assess the effect of height, flowers, and shoots on survival. Logistic regression is appropriate for binary outcome variables.
Plots:
Bar plot: Shows the number of survivals for each level of weeks_submerged.
Histograms and Bar plots: Visualize the distribution of survival with respect to height, flowers, and shoots.
Make sure you have the necessary libraries (tidyverse and broom) installed before running the code. You can install them using install.packages("tidyverse") and install.packages("broom") if needed.
