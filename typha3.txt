Here is an R script to analyze the effect of various factors on survival, including weeks_submerged, height, flowers, and shoots. The script performs statistical tests and generates relevant graphical representations.

Explanation:
Loading and Preparation:

Load the data and convert the survival column into a binary numeric variable where yes = 1 and no = 0.
Statistical Tests:

Fit a logistic regression model for each predictor (weeks_submerged, height, flowers, and shoots) against survival.
Summarize the models to check the significance of each predictor.
Graphical Representations:

Bar Plot: Displays the number of survivors by weeks submerged.
Scatter Plots with Logistic Regression Line: Show the relationship between survival probability and each continuous predictor (height, flowers, and shoots).
Saving Outputs:

The summaries of the logistic regression models are saved to text files for review.
Running the Script:
Place the cattail_data.csv in your working directory.
Run the script in R, and it will generate the plots and save the model summaries.
