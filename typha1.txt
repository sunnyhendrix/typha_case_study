Here is the R code that performs statistical tests to determine if weeks_submerged, height, flowers, or shoots affect survival. The code also provides graphical representations of the number of survivors by weeks submerged, and the effects of height, flowers, and shoots on survival.

Explanation:
Chi-Squared Test:

The code uses a Chi-squared test to determine if the number of weeks submerged significantly affects the survival of the cattail plants. The results are printed for interpretation.
Logistic Regression:

A logistic regression model is fitted to assess whether height, flowers, or shoots significantly influence survival. The summary and tidy version of the model are provided to interpret the coefficients.
Visualization:

The code generates bar plots to show survival by weeks submerged.
Scatter plots with logistic regression lines are provided to visualize the effect of height, flowers, and shoots on survival probability.
You can run this code in RStudio or any R environment where you have the necessary packages installed.
