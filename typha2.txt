Explanation of the Code:
Chi-square Test for weeks_submerged:

We use a chi-square test to assess whether the number of weeks submerged is associated with survival.
The result of the chi-square test is printed out.
Plotting Survival by Weeks Submerged:

A bar plot is created to visualize the distribution of survival across different levels of weeks submerged.
Logistic Regression:

A logistic regression model is fitted to determine if height, flowers, or shoots are significant predictors of survival.
The summary of the model gives us the significance of each predictor.
Plots for Height, Flowers, and Shoots:

Histograms and bar plots are created to visualize the distribution of survival with respect to height, flowers, and shoots.
You can run this code in your R environment to analyze the data and visualize the results.
