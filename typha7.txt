Here's an R script that will perform statistical tests to determine if weeks_submerged, height, flowers, and shoots affect survival, and provide graphical representations of the number of survivals by weeks_submerged, as well as the effects of other factors on survival. The script assumes the data is in a CSV file named cattail_data.csv.

Explanation:
Loading Libraries and Data:

tidyverse and ggplot2 are loaded for data manipulation and plotting.
Data is read from cattail_data.csv.
Data Preparation:

Convert survival to a factor for easier statistical analysis.
Convert weeks_submerged to a factor to handle it as a categorical variable.
Statistical Tests:

Chi-Square Test: Tests the independence between weeks_submerged and survival.
Logistic Regression: Tests the effects of height, flowers, and shoots on the binary survival outcome.
Graphical Representation:

Bar plot showing the count of survival across different weeks_submerged categories.
Histograms showing the distribution of height, flowers, and shoots for different survival statuses.
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed and the CSV file in the working directory. Adjust the file path if necessary.
