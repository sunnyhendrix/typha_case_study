# Load the data

# Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types

  mutate(

# 1. Statistical Test: Does weeks_submerged affect survival?

# Print the result of the test
print(weeks_submerged_test)

# 2. Plot: Number of survivals by weeks submerged

  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival by Weeks Submerged", x = "Weeks Submerged", y = "Count", fill = "Survival") +

# 3. Statistical Tests: Do height, flowers, or shoots affect survival?
# Height

# Flowers
flowers_test <- glm(survival ~ flowers, data = data, family = binomial)
summary(flowers_test)

# Shoots
shoots_test <- glm(survival ~ shoots, data = data, family = binomial)

# 4. Plot: Survival by height
ggplot(data, aes(x = height, fill = survival)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival by Height", x = "Height (cm)", y = "Count", fill = "Survival") +
  theme_minimal()

# 5. Plot: Survival by number of flowers
ggplot(data, aes(x = flowers, fill = survival)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Survival by Number of Flowers", x = "Number of Flowers", y = "Count", fill = "Survival") +
  theme_minimal()

# 6. Plot: Survival by number of shoots
ggplot(data, aes(x = shoots, fill = survival)) +

Explanation:
Chi-Square Test for weeks_submerged and survival: This test determines if there is a significant association between the number of weeks submerged and survival.

Visualization of Survival by Weeks Submerged: A bar plot visualizes the survival counts grouped by weeks submerged.

Logistic Regression for height, flowers, and shoots: These tests evaluate whether these variables significantly affect the likelihood of survival.

Visualizations:

Survival by Height: A histogram shows the distribution of heights for plants that survived versus those that did not.
Survival by Number of Flowers: A histogram for the number of flowers.
Survival by Number of Shoots: A histogram for the number of shoots.
How to Run:
Make sure the cattail_data.csv file is in your working directory.
Run the code in an R environment.
Output:
Statistical test results will be printed in the console.
Visualizations will be generated showing the distribution of survival by the relevant variables.
