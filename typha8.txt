To analyze whether weeks_submerged, height, flowers, or shoots affect survival, and to provide graphical representations of these effects, you can follow these steps in R:

Load the Data: Read the CSV file into R.
Data Preparation: Convert relevant columns to the appropriate data types.
Statistical Tests: Perform statistical tests to evaluate the effect of weeks_submerged, height, flowers, and shoots on survival.
Graphical Representation: Create plots to visualize the number of survivals by weeks_submerged, and relationships between height, flowers, shoots, and survival.
Here's a comprehensive R script to achieve this:

# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization
library(broom)      # For tidying model outputs
library(ggplot2)    # For creating plots

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("cattail_data.csv")

# Convert 'survival' to a factor for binary outcome
data$survival <- as.factor(data$survival)

# Check the data structure
str(data)

# 1. Statistical test for weeks_submerged
# Logistic regression to check if weeks_submerged affects survival
model_weeks_submerged <- glm(survival ~ weeks_submerged, data = data, family = binomial)

# Summarize the model
summary(model_weeks_submerged)
tidy(model_weeks_submerged)

# 2. Graphical representation of survival by weeks_submerged
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(weeks_submerged), fill = survival)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Weeks Submerged", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Survival by Weeks Submerged") +
  theme_minimal()

# 3. Statistical tests for height, flowers, and shoots
# Logistic regression to check if height, flowers, or shoots affect survival
model_height <- glm(survival ~ height, data = data, family = binomial)
model_flowers <- glm(survival ~ flowers, data = data, family = binomial)
model_shoots <- glm(survival ~ shoots, data = data, family = binomial)

# Summarize the models
summary(model_height)
summary(model_flowers)
summary(model_shoots)

# Tidy the models
tidy(model_height)
tidy(model_flowers)
tidy(model_shoots)

# 4. Graphical representations for height, flowers, and shoots

# Height vs Survival
ggplot(data, aes(x = height, fill = survival)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Height", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Survival by Height") +
  theme_minimal()

# Flowers vs Survival
ggplot(data, aes(x = flowers, fill = survival)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Number of Flowers", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Survival by Number of Flowers") +
  theme_minimal()

# Shoots vs Survival
ggplot(data, aes(x = shoots, fill = survival)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Number of Shoots", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Survival by Number of Shoots") +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:
Statistical Tests:

Logistic Regression (glm) is used to analyze the effect of weeks_submerged, height, flowers, and shoots on survival.
The summary() function provides details on the coefficients, significance, and fit of the model.
The tidy() function from the broom package is used to neatly display model outputs.
Graphical Representations:

Bar Plots: To visualize the proportion of survival by weeks_submerged, height, flowers, and shoots.
Make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using install.packages("tidyverse") and install.packages("broom") if you haven't already.
