To analyze the effect of weeks_submerged, height, flowers, and shoots on survival, we'll use a combination of statistical tests and visualizations in R. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

Load the Data
Data Cleaning
Statistical Tests
Visualization
Here's the R code for each of these steps:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("cattail_data.csv")

# Convert 'survival' to a factor
data$survival <- as.factor(data$survival)

# Check the structure of the data
str(data)

# 1. Test if weeks_submerged affects survival
# Create a logistic regression model
model_weeks_submerged <- glm(survival ~ weeks_submerged, data = data, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_weeks_submerged)

# 2. Test if height, flowers, or shoots affect survival
# Create a logistic regression model with multiple predictors
model_multiple <- glm(survival ~ height + flowers + shoots, data = data, family = binomial)

# Summary of the model
summary(model_multiple)

# 3. Graphical representation of the number of survival by weeks_submerged
# Create a bar plot of survival by weeks_submerged
ggplot(data, aes(x = as.factor(weeks_submerged), fill = survival)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Weeks Submerged", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Proportion of Survival by Weeks Submerged") +
  theme_minimal()

# Graph the effect of height, flowers, and shoots on survival
# Plot survival vs. height
ggplot(data, aes(x = height, fill = survival)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Height", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Survival Proportion by Height") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot survival vs. flowers
ggplot(data, aes(x = flowers, fill = survival)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Flowers", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Survival Proportion by Flowers") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot survival vs. shoots
ggplot(data, aes(x = shoots, fill = survival)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, position = "fill") +
  labs(x = "Shoots", y = "Proportion", fill = "Survival") +
  ggtitle("Survival Proportion by Shoots") +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:
Data Preparation: The read.csv function loads the dataset, and we convert survival into a factor for the logistic regression models.

Statistical Tests:

Weeks Submerged: A logistic regression model (model_weeks_submerged) tests if weeks_submerged affects survival.
Height, Flowers, and Shoots: Another logistic regression model (model_multiple) tests the effect of these variables on survival.
Visualization:

Survival by Weeks Submerged: A bar plot showing the proportion of survival for each week submerged.
Effect of Height, Flowers, and Shoots: Histograms showing the distribution of survival proportions across different values of height, flowers, and shoots.
Feel free to adjust binwidths or other parameters based on your specific data and preferences.
